# ðŸŒž TourPedia

This is a copy of TourPedia, a dataset about tourism
([homepage](http://tour-pedia.org)).

## Why are you hosting a copy of this dataset?

We are hosing this dataset, since we could not find it anywhere online
anymore.  At the same time, this dataset is used by other Linked
Datasets in [YALC](https://github.com/TriplyDB/YALC), so it is
important to have a copy of this dataset available.
